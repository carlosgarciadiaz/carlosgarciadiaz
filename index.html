											<h4>Introduction</h4>
											Gravitational lensing is a unique perceived phenomena caused by massive objects curving spacetime to such a degree that light can be bent. Galaxy clusters are the best objects to observe gravitational lensing. However, clusters by themselves do not enough matter to create a lensing effect. So why do we still observe lensing in galaxy clusters? The answer: Dark Matter.

								<p><h2><u>Supplemental Instructor</u></h2></p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/DSU.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>In the summer between my freshman and sophomore years, I had the privilege of being an College Algebra supplemental instructor (SI) for my schools summer bridge program. I would attend classes with the incoming freshman and organize lessons and homework help with the professors. I would the have a one hour session everyday in the afternoon with the students. Using different teaching styles, here I learned how valuable communication is in the academic sphere. Furthermore, working close with professors helped me better focus on specific concepts to more efficiently help students. Ultimately, I gained a enjoyment being able to serve others and I was offered a permanent position as a tutor.</p>
								<p><h2><u>Math and Physics Tutor</u></h2></p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/DSU Lib.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Being a tutor for a year, I encountered many different types of learners. Additionally, I also met with students that only wanted homework answers. Although I have grown to love math, many others do not share the same interest. However, I saw that the best tutors are there for the students, not themselves. If I wanted to truly teach I needed to understand not just what math issues a student has, but also give students the confidence to attempt difficult concepts. The selfless act of tutoring requires a someone to appreciate the differences in students to better cater to their needs. Furthermore, I gained a deeper appreciation for math and physics. During calculus tutoring sessions is when I saw the importance of fundamentals. The majority of problems students had were related to misunderstanding the basics. By taking a step back, I was able to show how the hierarchy requires time and patience to know the fundamentals. After knowing the basics, students were better prepared to tackle more complex concepts. Differential equations are a vital part of physics; Being a tutor has furthered my drive to learn and teach.</p>

								<p><h2><u>Vice President of NSBE</u></h2></p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/BEYA.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>I was introduced to the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE) my second year of college. At that time I would mostly work on my homework independently, until I joined NSBE. As a member, I started to get much more involved with both my peers, but also my professors. This led to me getting a research position for my junior year working under my professor Dr. Mohammad Amir Khan. Consequently, I could not continue being a tutor at the same time, so I decided to be a volunteer tutor for NSBE. I met many new friends by helping others in the club. Entering my senior year, I became vice president. Currently, I am fortunate enough to be able to help my peers by providing weekly study halls, recreational game nights, and attendance to conference all remotely. Although holding this position has given me much more responsibilities, I work together with my president and other board members to help be provide the most to the club's members. I have had an exceptional and teaching experience being a part of NSBE, and I only wish to continue to help my community.</p>
								<p><h2><u>First Place at DSU Hackathon</u></h2></p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Hack.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>The growing computer science community on my school's campus created the first Delaware State University Hackathon in 2020. My friends and I entered hoping that we would all learn a new skill, but most importantly, have a good time. The goal was to create something in 24 hours that could provide help to people. After brainstorming, my group decided to tackle a problem we were all familiar with: translation. Seeing as us three were immigrants, we had years of experience with having to help our parents with translations. With us being at college, we knew that our parents would still need help which resulting in us creating a prototype translation service app called Verbum. Our idea was to have a group of certified translators be on call at anytime to provide a translation for people. Essentially, we wanted to make the Uber of translating. We created a logo, an apple app interface, and a demo showing how a person-to-person connection can be more useful than using unreliable Google Translate. After the 24 hours, we presented in front of the judges. As they were announcing third and second place, we had thought we were going to leave empty handed. However, to our surprise we managed to get first place and win a few Playstation 4's in the process. This experience solidified how my curiosity can lead to altruism. I entered only expecting to learn, but winning was a good bonus!</p>
								<p><h2><u>DACA Story Sharing</u></h2></p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/DACA.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>When Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) was put into place, my parents knew that my sister and I would have a chance. As soon as I turned 16, I applied for and received my work authorization card. Nevertheless, I knew obtaining a bachelor's degree would still be an uphill battle. Although I am allowed to work, I cannot receive any federal money meaning I cannot attain a majority of scholarships. Therefore, when I was awarded the Dream.US opportunity scholarship, I was able to be enrolled in college and meet a community of students with similar immigration stories. Many of us decided to become local DACA advocates with the help of the United Methodist Church. We would go to different areas in Delaware and Maryland to share our stories. Many people were not very well aware of the struggles dreamers face; by going and talking to people we all learned to be more empathetic towards each other. Before, I was scared to let my peers know of my immigration status out of fear of being called an illegal alien. Sharing my story gave me confidence to explain instead of hide. I am very proud of my parents decision to immigrate to the United States and hope to repay the sacrifices they have made for me.</p>

								<p><h2><u>About Me</u></h2></p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Mesa.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
								<h3>My Story</h3>
								<p>I was born on September 11, 1999 in Mexico City. When I was one year old, my family immigrated to United States. My family struggled at first, moving from place to place. Eventually in 2006, we settled in a town in Idaho called Roberts where the population is about 500 people. The small town provided a perfect night sky that sparked my interest in Astronomy.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/dreamers.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<h3>High School to College</h3>
								<p>Being immigrants, my family faced many hardships; however, we worked hard so that my sister and I could attend college. I attained Differed Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) immigration status when I turned 16. This allowed me to get a job, but it did not permit me to receive any Federal money. Subsequently, I cannot obtain majority of scholarships. Also, my parents do not have the funds to send me to college, but I was awarded the Dream.US Opportunity scholarship that provided DACA students with full rides to various schools including Delaware State University. The above picture is of the 2016 and 2017 dreamer cohorts (I'm in the center right with the yellow tie!).</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Grand Can.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<h3>What Now?</h3>
								<p>Currently, I am in my final year at DSU where I have been able to continue my love for playing soccer recreationally. I am a massive FC Barcelona fan. Furthermore, I enjoy collecting music records and hiking. One of my most tiring experiences was my hike from the top of the Grand Canyon to the bottom and back to the top in one day. This was about 20 miles of beautiful landscapes and sore legs. Here's a picture of me at the bottom where it was a cool 120 degrees fahrenheit.</p>
